				<p>Our platform offers a secure network, enabling financial institutions to seamlessly exchange
					information via advanced cloud-based services and distributed event streaming technology. We assure
					unparalleled protection of sensitive customer data, facilitating a unique capability for
					institutions to confirm customer matches without the need to reveal any private information. This
					innovative approach ensures that sensitive data remains within the institution's secure network,
					effectively mitigating data protection risks and safeguarding customer privacy like never before.
				</p>
				<p>Our proprietary zero knowledge proof fuzzy matching algorithms are designed to securely and
					accurately match customer data across financial institutions, despite
					common challenges such as linguistic variations in names, outdated contact details, and
					inconsistently populated fields. These algorithms, protected by patents, enable complex matching
					processes that are not only highly effective in identifying customer overlaps but are also fully
					traceable, supporting audit requirements. To ensure the highest standards of accuracy and
					reliability, we have rigorously validated these algorithms using our own synthetic data generation
					method. This method produces millions of realistic, simulated customer profiles in CAIS format,
					encompassing a wide range of real-world variations, from minor spelling discrepancies to complete
					field omissions, providing a robust testing environment. Our synthetic data not only serves as a
					testament to our matching algorithm's capability but is also available as a service for institutions
					seeking to enhance their data analysis and protection strategies.
				</p>
				<ul> How it works:
					<li>Customer personal details in CAIS format are used to create a cryptographic keyset</li>
					<li>This keyset is unique to that customer - which means only those firms which have that individual
						as a customer can genearte it</li>
					<li>The keyset consists of an array of cryptographic hashes, revealing no recoverable information of
						the customer personal data</li>
					<li>Through the use of our proprietary fuzzy matching algorithms we can compare keysets of customers
						to determine if they are the same customer in different insitutions</li>
					<li>Crucially, this means that matching is achieved without the customer's personal data ever
						leaving the firm's secure domains</li>
					<li>Once </li>
