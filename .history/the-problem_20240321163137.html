				<p>Authorized Push Payment (APP) fraud involves deceiving customers into voluntarily sending money to
					accounts controlled by criminals.
				</p>
				<p>It is a growing global problem, but is most acute in countries with advanced banking systems offering
					real-time payments for retail customers - like the UK. The ability to move money instantaneously
					makes it highly attractive to fraudsters.
				</p>
				<p>Victims of APP fraud suffer not only financial loss but, also profound emotional and psychological
					distress. It is often the most vulnerable people in our society who are worst affected - cruelly
					targeted by criminal scammers. A common scenario involves individuals being misled by seemingly
					legitimate communication from their bank or another trusted entity like the police, prompting them
					to transfer funds under the guise of securing their accounts or confirming their identity.
				</p>
				<p>According to the 2023 UK Finance Fraud Report, fraud losses in the UK continue to run at over £1bn
					each year, with APP fraud accounting for around £0.5bn. The report also highlights the growing
					importance of co-operation and data sharing:
				</p>
				<p>“More can be done to prevent fraud, including easier data-sharing...” 
				</p>
				<p>Given the complex and evolving nature of APP fraud, it is imperative for all stakeholders within the
					UK financial ecosystem to remain agile and proactive in their approach to safeguarding consumers'
					financial well-being and maintaining the integrity of the digital banking environment.
